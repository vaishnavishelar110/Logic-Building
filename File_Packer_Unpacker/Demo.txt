"India is my country.
 All Indians are my brothers and sisters. 
 I love my country and I am proud of its rich and varied heritage. 
 I shall strive to be worthy of it. I shall respect my parents, teachers and all elders and treat everyone with courtesy. 
To my country and all my people, I pledge my devotion. In their well being and prosperity alone lies my happiness".
